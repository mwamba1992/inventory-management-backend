## ✅ Implementation Complete!

I've successfully implemented a complete WhatsApp Cloud API-based ordering system for your inventory management backend. Here's what has been built:

---

## 📦 What Was Created

### 1. **New Module Structure** (`src/whatsapp/`)

```
src/whatsapp/
├── entities/
│   ├── whatsapp-order.entity.ts          # Order records
│   ├── whatsapp-order-item.entity.ts     # Order line items
│   └── whatsapp-session.entity.ts        # Conversation sessions
├── services/
│   ├── whatsapp-api.service.ts           # WhatsApp Cloud API integration
│   ├── session.service.ts                # Session & cart management
│   ├── message-handler.service.ts        # Conversation flow logic
│   └── whatsapp-order.service.ts         # Order processing
├── dto/
│   ├── webhook.dto.ts                    # WhatsApp webhook payloads
│   └── create-order.dto.ts               # Order creation DTOs
├── interfaces/
│   └── message.interface.ts              # Message type definitions
├── whatsapp.controller.ts                # API endpoints
└── whatsapp.module.ts                    # Module registration
```

### 2. **Database Tables** (Auto-created via TypeORM)

#### `whatsapp_orders`
- Order management with status tracking
- Links to customers and warehouses
- Tracks total amount, delivery address, notes
- Timestamps for creation, confirmation, delivery

#### `whatsapp_order_items`
- Individual items in each order
- Quantity, unit price, total price
- Links to inventory items

#### `whatsapp_sessions`
- Persistent conversation sessions
- Cart storage (as JSON)
- State machine for conversation flow
- Context tracking (selected items, searches, etc.)

### 3. **API Endpoints**

| Method | Endpoint | Description |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| GET | `/whatsapp/webhook` | Webhook verification (Meta setup) |
| POST | `/whatsapp/webhook` | Receive incoming messages |
| GET | `/whatsapp/orders` | Get all WhatsApp orders |

## 📊 Order Management Features

### Order Status Workflow
```

## 🚀 Deployment Steps

### 1. Install Dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

### 2. Set Environment Variables
Create `.env` file with WhatsApp credentials (see `.env.example`)

### 3. Start Application
```bash
# Development
npm run start:dev

# Production
npm run build
npm run start:prod
```

### 4. Configure Webhook
- Use ngrok for local testing: `ngrok http 3000`
- Or deploy to production server with HTTPS
- Set webhook in Meta Developer Console:
  - URL: `https://your-domain/whatsapp/webhook`
  - Verify token: Same as in `.env`

### 5. Set Up Product Codes (NEW!)
```bash
# The 'code' field will be auto-created in the item table on first run
# Add product codes to your items via SQL or API

# Example SQL:
UPDATE core.item SET code = 'LAPTOP001' WHERE id = 1;
UPDATE core.item SET code = 'MOUSE042' WHERE id = 2;
# ... etc
```

**Code Format Best Practices:**
- Keep it short (5-10 characters): `PROD001`, `ELEC-045`
- Use uppercase for consistency
- Include category prefix (optional): `ELEC-`, `FOOD-`, `CLTH-`
- Avoid confusing characters (0 vs O, 1 vs I)

See `WHATSAPP_CODE_SEARCH_FEATURE.md` for detailed setup guide.

### 6. Test
Send a message to your WhatsApp Business number!
