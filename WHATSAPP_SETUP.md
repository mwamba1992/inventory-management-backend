# WhatsApp Chatbot Ordering System - Setup Guide

This guide will help you set up the WhatsApp Cloud API integration for the inventory management system.

## üìã Prerequisites

1. **Meta Business Account**: https://business.facebook.com/
2. **Meta Developer Account**: https://developers.facebook.com/
3. **WhatsApp Business App** (optional, for testing)

## üöÄ Step 1: Create Meta App

1. Go to [Meta for Developers](https://developers.facebook.com/)
2. Click **"My Apps"** ‚Üí **"Create App"**
3. Select **"Business"** as the app type
4. Fill in app details:
   - App Name: e.g., "Inventory Management Bot"
   - Contact Email: Your email
   - Business Account: Select your business account
5. Click **"Create App"**

## üì± Step 2: Add WhatsApp Product

1. In your app dashboard, find **"WhatsApp"** in the products list
2. Click **"Set Up"**
3. Select or create a **Meta Business Account**
4. Complete the setup wizard

## üîë Step 3: Get API Credentials

### Phone Number ID
1. Go to **WhatsApp** ‚Üí **API Setup**
2. Under **"From"** section, you'll see a phone number
3. Copy the **Phone Number ID** (not the phone number itself)
4. Add to `.env` file: `WHATSAPP_PHONE_NUMBER_ID=your_phone_number_id`

### Access Token
1. In the same API Setup page, find **"Temporary access token"**
2. For **production**, generate a **permanent token**:
   - Go to **Business Settings** ‚Üí **System Users**
   - Create a system user
   - Generate token with `whatsapp_business_messaging` and `whatsapp_business_management` permissions
3. Add to `.env` file: `WHATSAPP_ACCESS_TOKEN=your_access_token`

### Verify Token
1. Create your own custom verification token (any random string)
2. Add to `.env` file: `WHATSAPP_VERIFY_TOKEN=my_secret_verify_token_12345`

## üåê Step 4: Set Up Webhook

### Option A: Using ngrok (for local development)

1. Install ngrok: https://ngrok.com/download
2. Start your NestJS app:
   ```bash
   npm run start:dev
   ```
3. In a new terminal, start ngrok:
   ```bash
   ngrok http 3000
   ```
4. Copy the HTTPS URL (e.g., `https://abc123.ngrok.io`)

### Option B: Deploy to Production Server

Deploy your app to a server with HTTPS enabled (required by WhatsApp).

### Configure Webhook in Meta

1. Go to **WhatsApp** ‚Üí **Configuration** in your Meta App
2. Click **"Edit"** in the Webhook section
3. Enter your webhook details:
   - **Callback URL**: `https://your-domain.com/whatsapp/webhook`
   - **Verify Token**: The same token you set in `.env` file
4. Click **"Verify and Save"**
5. Subscribe to webhook fields:
   - ‚úÖ `messages`
   - ‚úÖ `message_status` (optional)

## ‚úÖ Step 5: Test the Integration

### Send a Test Message

1. Use the test phone number provided by Meta
2. Send a WhatsApp message to your business number
3. You should receive an automated response with the main menu

### Test Messages to Try:
- "menu" - Show main menu
- "help" - Show help information
- "cart" - View shopping cart
- "track" - Track orders

## üìä Step 6: Monitor Webhooks

### Check Webhook Logs
In your app logs, you should see:
```
[WhatsAppController] Webhook verified successfully
[WhatsAppController] Received webhook: {...}
[MessageHandlerService] Processing message from +1234567890
```

### Common Issues

#### Webhook Verification Failed
- Ensure `WHATSAPP_VERIFY_TOKEN` matches exactly in both `.env` and Meta webhook config
- Check that your server is accessible via HTTPS
- Verify the webhook URL is correct

#### Messages Not Received
- Check webhook subscription fields include `messages`
- Verify access token has correct permissions
- Check app logs for errors

#### Cannot Send Messages
- Verify `WHATSAPP_ACCESS_TOKEN` is valid
- Check `WHATSAPP_PHONE_NUMBER_ID` is correct
- Ensure test phone number is added in Meta dashboard (for testing)

## üéØ Step 7: Add Test Phone Numbers (Development)

1. Go to **WhatsApp** ‚Üí **API Setup**
2. Scroll to **"To"** section
3. Click **"Manage phone number list"**
4. Add phone numbers you want to test with
5. Each number will receive a verification code via WhatsApp

- [ ] Set up system user with appropriate permissions
- [ ] Configure webhook on production domain with HTTPS

### üî¢ Product Code Setup (Required for Code Search)

To enable the product code search feature:

1. **Start the application** - The `code` field will be auto-created in the `item` table
2. **Add product codes** to your items:
   ```sql
   UPDATE core.item SET code = 'LAPTOP001' WHERE id = 1;
   UPDATE core.item SET code = 'MOUSE042' WHERE id = 2;
   -- etc...
   ```
3. **Code format recommendations**:
   - Keep it short (5-10 characters): `PROD001`, `ELEC-045`
   - Use uppercase for consistency
   - Include category prefix for organization (optional)
   - Avoid confusing characters (0 vs O, 1 vs I)

4. **Use product codes in**:
   - Printed catalogs
   - Product labels/stickers
   - Email/SMS marketing campaigns
   - Customer repeat orders

See `WHATSAPP_CODE_SEARCH_FEATURE.md` for detailed setup instructions and best practices.
